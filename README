1.How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?

push(): It helped me add new items to the shopping cart easily. I didn’t have to create a new array or manually keep track of the items.

filter(): It helped me search or get specific items from the array. For example, if I wanted to find items starting with a certain letter, I could do it easily without checking each item one by one.

2.What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?

Making sure the search is case-insensitive (e.g., “Apple” vs “apple”).

Deciding whether to search by exact match or partial match (like typing “b” should show “Banana” and “Blueberry”).

Confusion between using map(), filter(), and for loops for different tasks.
Still i have problem using Map() so i did not useit here

3.How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?1. 

Prevent duplicates: Don’t allow adding the same item twice.

Clear all items: Add a “Clear Cart” button.

Better search: Add an input box to filter items as you type.

Make website more accessible
